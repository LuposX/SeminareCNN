# SeminareCNN
> This repo is about the Seminar "Grundlagen des maschinellen Lernens 1 & 2" I did at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in the summer semester 2023 where I had the Topic "Convolutional Neural Networks".

## Description

My Topic was "Convolutional Neural Networks" and I had the task to write a Paper and present a Presentation about this topic.
This Repository contains all the material I used for both of them.

The trainings and inference Code for my self-trained CNN for digit recognition can be found [here](Proseminar_MNIST_CNN.ipynb) in form of jupyter file.
Addtionally you can download the model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15QUc0498NM50-KL3woxGr6elq82t3ePx/view?usp=sharing).
