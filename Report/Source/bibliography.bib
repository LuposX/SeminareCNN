In this sense, multilayer feedforward networks are a class of universal approximators.}

ABSTRACT = {One of the most promising techniques used in various sciences is deep neural networks (DNNs). A special type of DNN called a convolutional neural network (CNN) consists of several convolutional layers, each preceded by an activation function and a pooling layer. The feature map of the previous layer is sampled by the pooling layer (that seems to be an important layer) to create a new feature map with condensed resolution. This layer significantly reduces the spatial dimension of the input. It always accomplished two main goals. As a first step, it reduces the number of parameters or weights to minimize computational costs. The second step is to prevent the overfitting of the network. In addition, pooling techniques can significantly reduce model training time and computational costs. This paper provides a critical understanding of traditional and modern pooling techniques and highlights the strengths and weaknesses for readers. Moreover, the performance of pooling techniques on different datasets is qualitatively evaluated and reviewed. This study is expected to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the importance of CNNs and pooling techniques in computer vision challenges.},

  abstract  = "An increasing number of genetic and metabolic anomalies have
               been determined to lead to cancer, generally fatal. Cancerous
               cells may spread to any body part, where they can be
               life-threatening. Skin cancer is one of the most common types of
               cancer, and its frequency is increasing worldwide. The main
               subtypes of skin cancer are squamous and basal cell carcinomas,
               and melanoma, which is clinically aggressive and responsible for
               most deaths. Therefore, skin cancer screening is necessary. One
               of the best methods to accurately and swiftly identify skin
               cancer is using deep learning (DL). In this research, the deep
               learning method convolution neural network (CNN) was used to
               detect the two primary types of tumors, malignant and benign,
               using the ISIC2018 dataset. This dataset comprises 3533 skin
               lesions, including benign, malignant, nonmelanocytic, and
               melanocytic tumors. Using ESRGAN, the photos were first
               retouched and improved. The photos were augmented, normalized,
               and resized during the preprocessing step. Skin lesion photos
               could be classified using a CNN method based on an aggregate of
               results obtained after many repetitions. Then, multiple transfer
               learning models, such as Resnet50, InceptionV3, and Inception
               Resnet, were used for fine-tuning. In addition to experimenting
               with several models (the designed CNN, Resnet50, InceptionV3,
               and Inception Resnet), this study's innovation and contribution
               are the use of ESRGAN as a preprocessing step. Our designed
               model showed results comparable to the pretrained model.
               Simulations using the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset showed that
               the suggested strategy was successful. An 83.2\% accuracy rate
               was achieved by the CNN, in comparison to the Resnet50 (83.7\%),
               InceptionV3 (85.8\%), and Inception Resnet (84\%) models.",

ABSTRACT={Deep learning techniques, and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have led to significant progress in image processing. Since 2016, many applications for the automatic identification of crop diseases have been developed. These applications could serve as a basis for the development of expertise assistance or automatic screening tools. Such tools could contribute to more sustainable agricultural practices and greater food production security. To assess the potential of these networks for such applications, we survey 19 studies that relied on CNNs to automatically identify crop diseases. We describe their profiles, their main implementation aspects and their performance. Our survey allows us to identify the major issues and shortcomings of works in this research area. We also provide guidelines to improve the use of CNNs in operational contexts as well as some directions for future research.}
