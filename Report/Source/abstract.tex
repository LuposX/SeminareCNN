\section*{Abstract}
In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the field of Machine Learning, particularly in the domain of image-related tasks.
This proseminar aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful class of neural networks widely employed for image analysis and processing.
In addition to that, this paper presents a CNN model that is trained from scratch, specifically for digit classification. The model achieves solid performance and can accurately classify hand-drawn digits.
